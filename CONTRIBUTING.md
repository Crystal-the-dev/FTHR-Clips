# Contributing to FTHR Clips

Thanks for wanting to contribute. Here's everything you need to know.

Start from a clean checkout, confirm the current branch and worktree state, and
do not mix generated build output or personal configuration into source changes.

There is **no** `engine/` directory and **no** `ui/` directory at the top
level. Any document telling you otherwise predates two refactors.

### Entry points

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Application | `FTHR_UI/main.py` (`python FTHR_UI/main.py`) |
| Windows engine | `FTHRcapture/FTHRclips/src/main.cpp` → `FTHRcapture/x64/Release/FTHRclips.exe` |
| Linux engine | `FTHRcapture_linux/src/main.cpp` → `FTHRcapture_linux/build/FTHRclips` |
| Product version | `FTHR_UI/version.py` |
| IPC contract | `FTHR_UI/core/capture_bridge.py` ↔ `FTHRcapture/FTHRclips/include/shared_memory.h` |

### Generated — never edit, never commit

`build/`, `dist/`, `Output/`, `FTHRcapture/x64/`, `FTHRcapture/FTHRclips/x64/`,
`FTHRcapture_linux/build/`, `AppDir/AppRun`, `AppDir/usr/`, `.vs/`,
`build/version_win.txt`, `__pycache__/`, `*.AppImage`, and the FFmpeg runtime
under `FTHRcapture/FTHRclips/third_party/ffmpeg/bin/`.

## Setup

Python **3.14** is what the alpha is built with. 3.12 and 3.13 are also
exercised in CI. Install from the lock files, not from a loose `pip install`:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd FTHR_Clips
python -m pip install -r requirements-alpha.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
```

`requirements.in` is the human-edited list of direct dependencies.
`requirements-alpha.txt` is the pinned lock and the only thing a release build
installs from. Never add a `>=` constraint to the lock.

> `imageio-ffmpeg` must **not** be installed into a build environment. It
> bundles a GPLv3 FFmpeg. The app uses the LGPL `ffmpeg.exe` / `ffprobe.exe`
> shipped next to the engine — see `FTHR_UI/core/ffmpeg_tools.py` and AUDIT-005.

### Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` is set automatically by `tests/conftest.py`.

### Lint

```bash
python -m ruff check .
```

### Windows engine

Needs Visual Studio 2022 (Desktop C++ workload) and the FFmpeg runtime:

```powershell
python tools\fetch_third_party.py --all     # FFmpeg DLLs + vc_redist
& "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe" `
    FTHRcapture\FTHRcapture.sln -p:Configuration=Release -p:Platform=x64
python -m PyInstaller FTHR.spec --clean
```

The FFmpeg headers and import libraries are tracked in git, so the engine
compiles from a clean clone. The 152 MB of runtime DLLs are not; the fetch
script pulls them from the exact BtbN release pinned by sha256 in
`tools/ffmpeg_manifest.json`.

See [`BUILDING.md`](BUILDING.md) for the full walkthrough.

### Linux engine

```bash
# Deps: cmake, gcc, pkg-config, ffmpeg, libpulse, wayland-protocols, wayland-scanner
cd FTHRcapture_linux
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j"$(nproc)"
```

Full AppImage:

```bash
./build_linux.sh
```

See [`BUILDING.md`](BUILDING.md).

## The shared-memory contract

The UI and the engine talk through one fixed-layout struct in shared memory.
There is no serialisation and no handshake. **If the two definitions drift by a
single byte, every field after the drift point reads garbage — silently, at
runtime, with no build error.**

Three definitions must stay in lockstep:

| Side | File |
|---|---|
| Python | `FTHR_UI/core/capture_bridge.py` — `SharedMemoryLayout` (separate win32 / posix branches) |
| Windows engine | `FTHRcapture/FTHRclips/include/shared_memory.h` |
| Linux engine | `FTHRcapture_linux/src/shared_memory.h` |

Rules:

1. **Never reorder fields.** Append only.
2. **Never change a field's type or array extent** without changing all three.
3. **Never reuse command IDs 4–9.** Those are the retired `SET_*` commands.
   They are dead, but an engine built before they were retired still acts on
   those numbers — reusing one would make an old binary do the wrong thing
   instead of ignoring an unknown command.
4. **Bump `CaptureBridge.SHARED_MEM_NAME`** (`FTHR_SharedMemory_v3` → `_v4`)
   whenever the layout changes, so an old engine and a new UI cannot map the
   same region. Do **not** bump it for a product version change — it is not
   the product version.
5. Run the checker before you push:

   ```bash
   python tools/verify_shared_memory_contract.py
   ```

   It parses both C++ headers, models the compiler's alignment, and compares
   field order, types, array extents, offsets and total size against the ctypes
   struct — for both platforms, from any platform. It also runs as part of
   `pytest` (`tests/test_shared_memory_contract.py`).

Current layout: 23 fields, 2712 B on Windows, 4248 B on Linux.

## Other conventions

- **Settings live in `~/.fthr/settings.json`** via `SettingsManager`. Don't add
  a second config file — one was already removed.
- **Design tokens come from `FTHR_UI/ui/style.py`.** Don't inline new colours
  or font sizes; add them there.
- **The product version comes from `FTHR_UI/version.py`.** Don't type a version
  literal anywhere else. `tools/verify_version_consistency.py` will fail you.
- Sound assets live in `FTHR_UI/assets/sounds/`.

## Making changes

1. Branch: `git checkout -b fix/my-fix`
2. Make your changes
3. `python -m pytest tests/` and `python -m ruff check .`
4. `python tools/scan_repo_hygiene.py --staged` before committing
5. Commit with a clear message (style below)
6. Open a pull request

## Commit style

```
type: short description

Longer explanation if needed.
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`

Examples:
```
fix: clip_ready never set when multiband mux fails
feat: add per-monitor capture selection
build: pin alpha dependencies exactly (AUDIT-009)
```

## What we're looking for

- Bug fixes
- Linux hardware compatibility (AMD/Intel GPU capture, other Wayland compositors)
- Windows testing and fixes
- Test coverage — the C++ engines currently have **none**
- Documentation improvements

## What to avoid

- Large refactors without prior discussion
- Adding dependencies without a strong reason — and never a GPL one, see
  `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`
- Changing UI layout without screenshots in the PR
- Committing anything under the "generated" list above

## Code style

- **Python:** match the surrounding code. `ruff` enforces a deliberately narrow
  rule set (real bugs, not cosmetics) — see `pyproject.toml`.
- **C++:** C++17, 4-space indent, snake_case.
- Comments only where the *why* is non-obvious.
